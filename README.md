Hello there,

I like your modern animated python desktop designer with pyqt.
In the delivery, I would like to have a .ui file and a .py file along with the icons/.rcc file you use in the UI. I dont need you to link the functions in my scripts, I will link them myself.

In the UI, I would like 4 - 5 stacked widgets on top of the settings menu:

Page 1 Upload Data:
I need 1 QDateEdit to select the date, 30 checkboxes in 3 groups (left middle right frames) with file names, and a button to upload, and a textlabel to display my errors if any.
A progress bar would be nice but not required.

Page 2 Run Reports:
I need 1 QDateEdit to select the date, 20 checkboxes (in 2 groups, left and right) with file names, and a button to generate report, and a textlabel to display my errors if any.
A progress bar would be nice but not required.

Page 3 API Use:
I need the frame to be broken down into left and right frames,
On left frame: need 1 QDateEdit to select the date, 10 checkboxes and a button to generate file, and a textlabel to display my errors if any.
On the right frame: need 1 QDateEdit to select the date, 1 folder selector, 1 file selector, 1 number scroller with options 10K, 50K, 100K, 500K, 1 text input default to 'myportfolioname', 1 text input default to 'myportfoliodescription', and 1 textlabel to display my errors if any.

Page 4 User setting:
Need 2 different user settings:

1. Snowflake user setting:
   Need input account, region, user, authenticator method, warehouse, database, schema, and role
   They'll all take some default value 'abcdefg'
2. Project user setting:
   Need account and password
   They'll all take some default value 'abcdefg'

*All QDateEdits should default to current day

Please let me know if this is doable and your quote! Thanks!
